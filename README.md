# 🍒 U Pick Cherries 🍒

A modern React based redesign of the **Villa del Sol Sweet Cherry Farms** website. This project transforms an outdated website into a clean, mobile-friendly, and visually appealing experience. Inspired by my personal visits to the farm, I built this from scratch to sharpen my frontend skills and offer the farm a better online presence.

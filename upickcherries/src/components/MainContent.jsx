                    <p>Villa del Sol is family owned. Gary works the farm every day to sell his 
                        cherries once a year when they are ripe for picking. Despite the inflationary 
                        cost increases Villa del Sol has had to absorb these last couple of years 
                        (much higher costs for water, materials, equipment, fertilizer, etc.), Gary and 
                        Maxi have again decided <b>NOT</b> to increase the price of our cherries this year.</p>
                    
                    <p>But remember, we are in the business of selling cherries. We have UPICK only. We do 
                        not sell commercially at all. We do <b>NOT</b> allow eating the cherries while picking in 
                        the orchard. We also have a <b>$10.00 per person minimum purchase requirement</b>. Whatever 
                        you pick you purchase. We sell our cherries for a couple of weeks to about a month 
                        per year, so Pick, Pay then Eat!</p>

                    <p>Thank you for all of your support.</p>
